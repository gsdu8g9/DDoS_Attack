# Raw Packet Generator

#
# This is a very simple packet generator.
# You can enter specific information of packet what you want to capture.
# Then, the program will send bunch of packets (most of them is dummy, but only few is yours).
# To run the program, you need root permission.
#
#
# USAGE
#
# [-d] option should be entered
# For [-d] and [-s], you can set partial data, but ':' is needed.
# For example, if you want to set dst ip only, then
#   ./generator -d xxx.xxx.xxx:
#              if you want to set src port only, then
#   ./generator -s :8080
#
# [-t] option is protocol.
# Here is the list:  ip
#                    tcp
#                    udp
#                    get
#                    post
#
# Only lowercase is accepted.
#
# [-n] option is limits the number of packets will be sent.
# If you don't enter this option, only one packet is sent which has entered information.
#
# [-f] option means infinite packet generating.
#
# If you want to stop during loop, just interrup the program (ctrl+c)
# then it will notice how many packets which have entered information are sent.
# Just compare with your IDS :)
